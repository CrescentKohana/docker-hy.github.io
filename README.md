We've already begun taking in beta testers. Beta testing is not the same as completing course normally. If you wish to complete the course as intended sign up for "DevOps with Docker" in weboodi and join the course when it's starting.

Main differences compared to normal course:
- Exercises are not yet complete
  * You cannot yet submit exercises anywhere, you can start doing them however
  * Some exercises will appear later
  * When we start taking submissions for parts there might be more exercises that you have to do

- Material is not yet complete
  * Material has actual *false information* and might teach you something you wish to forget
  * Beta testers are encouraged to find any misleading information and create an [issue](https://github.com/docker-hy/docker-hy.github.io/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/docker-hy/docker-hy.github.io/pulls)

However:

- Exercises done in beta will count towards your final exercise score if you decide to stop beta testing (You can submit an exercise done in beta as your actual submission during winter)

# Beta testing timeline:

All parts are under testing. Final exercises for part 3 are available before 15.12.

Beta deadlines, please note that these are not "hard deadlines" as there might be major changes:
 
Deadline for parts 1 and 2 is 15.12. Please note that the numbering has changed for part 1 when submitting exercises.

Deadline for part 3 is 22.12, but this text should be removed by 18.12

Submissions for beta testers will be allowed until 22.12. but if you can't make it we can transfer the exercises to the official course.

Link for exercise submissions is on the exercises page.

Official course starts 18.12.18 and ends 13.1.19

# Beta testers can suggest new exercises. If you design a new exercise your name and github link will be displayed on the exercise as "This exercise was created by --". Designers of new exercises do not have to complete said exercise.

Thank you for your help. If you have any questions send email jami.kousa@helsinki.fi or send message in course telegram group.
