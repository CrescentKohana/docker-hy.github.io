We've already begun taking in beta testers. Beta testing is not the same as completing course normally. If you wish to complete the course as intended sign up for "DevOps with Docker" in weboodi and join the course when it's starting.

Main differences compared to normal course:
- Exercises are not yet complete
  * You cannot yet submit exercises anywhere, you can start doing them however
  * Some exercises will appear later
  * When we start taking submissions for parts there might be more exercises that you have to do

- Material is not yet complete
  * Material has actual *false information* and might teach you something you wish to forget
  * Beta testers are encouraged to find any misleading information and create an [issue](https://github.com/docker-hy/docker-hy.github.io/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/docker-hy/docker-hy.github.io/pulls)
  
However:

- Exercises done in beta will count towards your final exercise score if you decide to stop beta testing (You can submit an exercise done in beta as your actual submission during winter)

Thank you for your help. If you have any questions send email jami.kousa@helsinki.fi or send message in course telegram group.
