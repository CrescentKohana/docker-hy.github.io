  <h1>3.7 Kubernetes</h1>

  Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes terminology and draw a diagram.

  Similarly to the networking diagrams in part 2. You will need to draw a diagram of three host machines in a Kubernetes cluster. The cluster is running two applications.
  
  The applications may have other machines that are not part of the cluster. The applications running across the three host machines can be anything you want. All of the three machines should be utilized. Include "your own computer" in the diagram as the one sending instructions via kubectl to deploy an application. In addition include a HTTP message coming from the internet to your Kubernetes cluster and how it may reach an application.

  Make sure to label the diagram so that anyone else who has completed this exercise, and read the glossary, would undestand it. The diagram should contain at least the following labels: Pod, Cluster, Container, Service.

  I prefer to use [draw.io](https://draw.io) but you can use whichever tool you want.
