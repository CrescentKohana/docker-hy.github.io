  <h1>1.7</h1>

  By default our `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine` doesn't have a CMD. It instead uses *ENTRYPOINT* to declare which application is run.

  We'll talk more about "ENTRYPOINT" in the next section, but you already know that the last argument can be used to give command.

  As you might've noticed it doesn't start the web service even though the name is "simple-web-service". A command is needed to start the server!

  Try `docker run devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine hello`. The application reads the argument but will inform that hello isn't accepted.

  In this exercise create a Dockerfile and use FROM and CMD to create a brand new image that automatically runs the server. 
  Tag the new image as "web-server"

  Return the Dockerfile and the command you used to run the container.

  > We don't have any method of accessing the web service yet. As such confirming that the console output is the same will suffice.
