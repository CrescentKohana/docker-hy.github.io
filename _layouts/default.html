        The 2019 course ends 17.01.2020. Make sure you submit your progress & do the "Final Exercise" before that.

        The <a href="https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/aytkt21025en/132141109">2020 course</a> starts 15.04.2020, and you can expand your 2019 course completion. You should submit your progress and do the "Final Exercise" if you want to avoid having to redo exercises in parts that you've already done by 17.01.

        The course material is still available here during the downtime, but will undergo changes.
